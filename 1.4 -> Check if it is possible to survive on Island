Hint
-----
N – The maximum unit of food you can buy each day.
S – Number of days you are required to survive.
M – Unit of food required each day to survive.

Example 1:
----------
Input: S = 10, N = 16, M = 2
Output: 2
Explaination: One possible solution is to 
buy a box on the first day (Monday), 
it’s sufficient to eat from this box up to 
8th day (Monday) inclusive. Now, on the 9th 
day (Tuesday), you buy another box and use 
the chocolates in it to survive the 9th and 
10th day.

Example 2:
---------
Input: S = 10, N = 20, M = 30
Output: -1
Explaination: She can’t survive even if 
she buy food because the maximum number 
of units she can buy in 1 day is less the 
required food for 1 day.

code:
----
 int minimumDays(int S, int N, int M){
        // code here
        int sunday = S/7;
        
        int buyingDays = S-sunday;
        
        int totalFood = M*S;
        
        int ans=0;
        
        if(totalFood % N == 0){
            ans = totalFood/N;
        }
        else{
            ans = totalFood/N + 1;
        }
        
        if(ans <= buyingDays){
            return ans;
        }
        else{
            return -1;
        }
    }
