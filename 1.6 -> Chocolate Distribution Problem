Example 1:
---------
Input:
N = 8, M = 5
A = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12}
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum difference between 
maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates 
is 9 - 3 = 6 by choosing following M packets :
{3, 4, 9, 7, 9}.

Example 2:
----------
Input:
N = 7, M = 3
A = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56}
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum difference between
maximum chocolates and minimum chocolates
is 4 - 2 = 2 by choosing following M packets :
{3, 2, 4}.

code:
-----
long long findMinDiff(vector<long long> a, long long n, long long m){
    //code
    
    //sort
    sort(a.begin(),a.end());
    int i = 0;
    int j = m-1;
    
    long long mini = INT_MAX;
    
    while(j < a.size()){
        long long minChoc = a[i];
        long long maxChoc = a[j];
        long long diff = maxChoc - minChoc;
        mini = min(mini,diff);
        i++;
        j++;
    }
    return mini;
    }
